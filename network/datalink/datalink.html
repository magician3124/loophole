                        When we think of data link layer we can consider it as the stuffing in a sandwich. And the two slices of bread that hold it are <strong>physical layer and network layer.</strong> Data link layer must make sure data from physical layer is correctly transmitted to network layer and vice versa. And we will cover how it performs this task in the following article. <br>Before getting started let's first look at some devices you need to know.

                            <b>Hub:</b><br>
                            Hub is a stupid guy who can’t remember others’ names just like me xd. So, whenever he’s in charge of sending data to someone, he always sends it to everyone. So, if today computer A meant to send a package to computer B and computer A accidentally sent the package to a hub instead of a <strong>switch</strong> (we will talk about it later), not only computer B will receive the package, but every computer that is connected to the hub will receive the same package. This is because hubs will copy the package many times making sure that every computer on its ports will receive a package. Moreover, It is usually used in <strong>LAN (Local Area Network).</strong>

                            If hubs are the stupid guys then switches are the smart ones. Switches would memorize the <strong>MAC address</strong> of each device that is connected to it. In other words, if one day he has to send a package to computer A then only computer A will receive the package. Switches can be separated into two types: <strong>layer 2 switches and layer 3 switches.</strong> Basically, layer 3 switches can perform every layer 2 switches’ functions, and we will talk about what it can do additionally next time when we enter <strong>layer 3 – network layer.</strong>

                        <br>
                        MAC stands for <strong>Media Access Control.</strong> It is a hardware address meaning that it is <strong>unique and unchangeable</strong>. It is also a physical address or burn-in address, but they kind of mean the same thing. Usually mac address is tied with your Network Interface Card (NIC, a computer circuit card that makes your computer able to connect to the internet).

                        Here’s an example of a MAC address of an Ethernet NIC: 00:0a:86:9d:78:17
                        As you can see, it is generated by <strong>8 octets</strong> and each octet stand for <strong>8 bits.</strong> Moreover, they can be separated by <strong>colons or dashes.</strong>

                        For the first <strong>3 octets</strong> are known as <strong>Organizationally unique identifier (OUI),</strong> which is assign to a manufacturer by the <strong>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Registration Authority.</strong> Which means by looking at it you can probably figure out who made your network adapter or NICs.

                            Bridge is a device that is designed to separate the network into segments in order to reduce collision. Each segment has its own <strong>collision domain.</strong> And because each collision has its own bandwidth, which means bridge can also improve the network performance. Bridge is a layer two device that can forward or filter data. However, it is no longer a common thing we use. Instead, we prefer <strong>switches.</strong>

                Let’s get back to our topic – data link layer. Data link layer functions on connections that are <strong>point to point or broadcast.</strong> And you might start wondering, “what is broadcasting?” A <strong>broadcast message</strong> is a message that is sent from a single system to all the other systems in the same <strong>broadcast domain.</strong>
                <br><br>
                <div class="question">Then you might ask “so… what is a broadcast domain?”</div>
<!--                <br>-->
                <ul>
                    Before answering that question, let’s first make sure you understand what ethernet is.
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <b>Ethernet: </b>
                        <br>
                        Ethernet is a technology used in wired <strong>LAN or WAN (Wide Area Network)</strong> environment. It functions to transmit data and makes sure other devices can recognize and process the information.
                        <br><br>
                        Now let’s talk about broad cast domain.
                        <br><br>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <b>Broadcast Domain:</b>
                        <br>
                        It is a specific network segment that all devices can communicate with each other through <strong>ethernet broadcast</strong>. Although, I haven’t explained what router is. It is important for you to know that router will divide a LAN in to multiple <strong>broadcast domain</strong> and each <strong>port</strong> on the router is in different domains.
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="piccontainer">

                        <br>
                        In the picture above you can see that all ports on devices such as <strong>bridges, hubs, and switches</strong> are on the same domain. 
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <div class="question">“So, what are some data link’s function?”</div>
                <ul>
                    <b>Framing:</b>
                    <br>
                    Like how I described data link layer, it is the stuffing in a sandwich. It will receive the packets from Network layer and make them into frames. But why? Why don’t we use packets to transmit data? Is it necessary to use a new unit? Well, the answer is yes. Framing makes sure that data sent from the senders makes sense to the receivers, and it also makes it easier to detect corruption as data is broken down into pieces. Usually, the structure of frames contains a <strong>header</strong> but not always a <strong>trailer</strong>, and the header is used to store information such as <strong>error-checking codes and addressing information.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <div class="piccontainer">
                            <img src="http://loophole.studio/images/osi_model/datalink/frame.png" alt="" id="frame">
                        </div>
                    <br>
                    The first thing to do: identify frames.
                    <br>
                    Receivers have to know where frames start and end so that they can identify the transmitted data.
                    <br>
                    Types of framing: <strong>Fixed length (bits) framing, fixed duration (second) framing, and length-based framing.</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <b>Fixed length (bits) framing:</b>
                        <br>
                        In this type of framing, the receivers are easier to understand and process the frames. However, it is inefficient when you are dealing with small payloads. Moreover, it will also be inconvenient to handle big payloads because you have to break them down making them fragmented.
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="question">
                            So, you might ask, “What is a better way of framing?”
                        </div>
                        <br>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <b>Length-based framing:</b>
                        <br>
                        Well, we have length-based framing. Instead of a fixed length, every frame declares how long it is. But it might still not be an ideal way because you have to make sure the receivers read the length field correctly, and it also means the receivers have to identify the beginning.

                    So, it brings us to another alternative: <strong>Flags or Sentinels.</strong>
                    Think about it. What if we use something recognizable to identify the start and the end of a frame? One type of indicators is a special bit or byte pattern in the header or trailer. However, it does have disadvantages. For example, special bit or byte pattern can sometimes overlap with the bits in the data, which makes the frame start later or end earlier.

                    But there is a solution to the problem above.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Stuffing:</b>
                    <br>
                    This method inserts bits or bytes into data so that flags or sentinels won’t appear in the data stream. Usually the bit pattern of sentinels would be 01111110 (0x7E), and it is designed for High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) and Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC).
                    <br><br>
                    <div class="question">So, where do we insert the bits?</div>
                    <br>
                    Whenever the senders see 5 ones beside each other, it would add a one beside them since there are 6 ones in our sentinel (01111110). When the receivers are destuffing, it would basically remove 1 zero when they read 5 ones. If there is no zero to remove means two things: there is either a flag or an error. Also, 01111111 (0x7F) is unacceptable in a data stream.
                    <br><br>
                    Let’s now do some math. If we use 01110 as a flag meaning that we have to insert 1 zero every 2 ones. In other words, if we use 01*n0 we have to insert 1 zero every n-1 ones. In addition, when the payload is long, we should use a long flag, and when the payload is short, we should use a short flag.
                    <br><br>
                    Let’s now put it in the scale of bytes
                    It is generally similar to bit stuffing, but there are two different flags: STX and ETX. One at the very beginning, and one at the very end. In order to prevent these two flags to appear in the payload there is another character known as DLE (data-link escape) to solve this problem. However, things can get really bad when DLE accidentally appears in the payload.
