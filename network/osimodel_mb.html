                <h1 id="PhysicsLayer">Physical Layer</h1>
                <p>Physical layer is all about physical medium (physical connection). Think about things you can physically touch that are used to transfer data, such as <strong>cables, pinouts, voltages, NIC</strong> (Network interface card), <strong>hub, and repeater</strong> (I know some of them you might not be familiar with. It’s okay, we will discuss them in the future). Equipment above is considered part of the physical layer. Now, let’s talk about what are some of its major functions: <strong>transforming bits, data rate, synchronization, line configuration, topologies, transmission modes </strong><a href="http://loophole.studio/subwebsite/network/osimodel.html" onclick="return false" onmousedown="cite_1()">[1]</a></p>
                
                <b id="Transform">1. Transforming Bits:</b>
                <br>So, as you might know, bits are used to transfer data, and Physical layer is the one that encodes bits into signals. You might start wondering, “why is it important to encode them into signals?” Well, if you are transferring data through a physical medium you have to make them into signals. Let’s say one day you have to send your table computer to a different country because you are about to study abroad, there is no way you can just send the whole computer without disassembling it.

                <br>Let’s talk about signals that I’ve just mentioned. Signals can be divided into two categories: <strong>digital signals</strong> and <strong>analog signals</strong>. <a href="http://loophole.studio/subwebsite/network/osimodel.html" onclick="return false" onmousedown="cite_3()">[3]</a>

                        As you have seen, digital signals are <strong> square waves.</strong> Besides, it uses binary code to transmit data, meaning that information is represented by <strong>“1”</strong> and <strong>“0”</strong>. Usually, “1” represents a <strong>high</strong> voltage and “0” represents a <strong>low</strong> voltage. Digital signals are generated by <strong>digital modulations</strong> which make them be time separated. It is also more accurate than analog signals. The reason for bringing this up is because it is often used in <strong>computing and digital electronics.</strong>

                        Different from digital signals, analog signals are <strong>sine waves</strong>, which are continuous signals. It is often used in <strong>audio and video transmission.</strong>Examples of it would be something like signals from <strong>temperature sensors and light sensors</strong>. However, there is a downside of it, which is that it can be easily deteriorated by <strong>noise</strong>.

                <br>Physical layer is also in charge of defining how fast the transmission is <strong>(how many bits per sec)</strong>. It is also known as <strong>data rate</strong> and can be directly related to <strong>bandwidth (physical limitation) and error-rate.</strong>

                <br>This is kind of complicated so here's a <a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~comp2322/Bit and Frame Synchronization Techiques.pdf" target="_blank">link</a> I found that provides more detailed explanation) An easier way to think is that the inconsistent of the speed between the receiver and the sender often leads to a traffic jam. So, to solve this problem synchronization informs the receiver where data entities start and end.

                <br>Multiplexing is a way of letting digital signal and analog signal passing through a shared medium simultaneously. Remember all medium all capable of multiplexing, no matter the medium is air (<strong>radio frequency</strong>), physical medium, or light (<strong>optical fiber</strong>). The basic concept of multiplexing is that when multiple computers (senders) send signals to a single medium, there is a device known as the <strong>multiplexer (MUX)</strong> collecting all the signals and distribute them to different parts of the medium. When signals are sent to the other side, another device known as the <strong>De-multiplexer (DEMUX)</strong> will identify all the signals and send them to their destination. Now let’s talk about different types of multiplexing.

                <img src="http://loophole.studio/images/osi_model/physical_layer/multiplexing.png" alt="" id="long_pic">

                <b id="fdm">Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM): </b><a href="http://loophole.studio/subwebsite/network/osimodel.html" onclick="return false" onmousedown="cite_4()">[4]</a>
                <br>FDM is used for analog signals. This technology is utilized when the carrier is frequency and signals are sent simultaneously. It might be easier to understand by looking at the following picture.  
                <img src="http://loophole.studio/images/osi_model/physical_layer/fdm_v2.png" id="long_pic">
                <br>
                Frequency spectrum is divided into logical channels, and a frequency known as guard band is used to separate them to avoid overlapping.
                <br><br>

                <b id="tdm">Time Division Multiplexing (TDM): </b><a href="http://loophole.studio/subwebsite/network/osimodel.html" onclick="return false" onmousedown="cite_4()">[4]</a>
                <br>Different from FDM, TDM can be used to process both analog and digital signals. Signals in FDM are sent simultaneously but with different frequency. On the other hand, signals in TDM are sent with the same frequency but at different time. This technology is used when the data rate of the media is greater than that of the source.

                <strong>
                When we reach the next layer, don't get confuse with TDM frames and frames we use in the next layer. They are different things!
                </strong>
                <br><br>
                In the diagram above, we can see that data are break down into small pieces and each piece will form a frame with each other. Now let's talk about the two different type of TDM: <strong>Synchronous TDM and Asynchronous TDM.</strong>
                <br><br>

                <b id="syncTdm">Synchronous TDM: </b><a href="http://loophole.studio/subwebsite/network/osimodel.html" onclick="return false" onmousedown="cite_4()">[4]</a>
                <br>This type of TDM is used in the transmission of digitized voice stream. Each slot in each frame is fixed, which means if the data is not ready, an empty slot will be transmited. 
                
                <img src="http://loophole.studio/images/osi_model/physical_layer/synctdm.png" id="long_pic">

                <br>Different from Synchronous TDM, Asynchronous TDM's slot are dynamic. It depends on the speed of the source and their ready state, which means that it can save channel capacity.

                <br>This technology is used in <strong>analog signals.</strong> Because of the different wavelengths, signals (lights) are distinguishable. Moreover, it will be multiplex into an <strong>optical fiber</strong>. You can think it as a different form of FDM but the signals are light.
                <br><br>

                <b id="cdm">Code Division Multiplexing (CDM): </b><a href="http://loophole.studio/subwebsite/network/osimodel.html" onclick="return false" onmousedown="cite_2()">[2]</a>
                <br>In all the different ways of multiplexing above, we pay our main focus on how to distinguish data after passing through the medium. What if we just give each signal a unique code to identify them? CDM, also called <strong>spread-spectrum technique,</strong> allows multiple data transmit over a single frequency. Moreover, it will make each signal carry a unique code known as <strong>chip.</strong> In this case, since the receiver know the chip in advance, it is able to identify the data and send it to its correct destination.

                <br>Physical layer also controls how different devices are arranged in the network by using topologies. For example, <strong> Mesh, Star, Ring and Bus.</strong>

                <br>Physical layer determines the direction of the connection. Here are some terms for different orientations, such as <strong>Simplex (one direction), Half Duplex (both directions, not the same time), Full Duplex (both directions, simultaneously)</strong>
