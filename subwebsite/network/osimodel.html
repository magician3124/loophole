                    <h1>Purpose for OSI model:</h1>
                    <p>Think about it. If one day you want to tell someone that there is a problem with your network connection. What are you going to say?
                        “Hey, there is a problem while connecting to the server! ” (what kind of problem? )
                        “Hey, the server is not responding!” (what do you mean “not responding? ” )
                        When network engineers communicate these types of questions, it often leads to misinterpretation. So, what is a reasonable way to identify an error? If you are looking for an answer to this question, OSI model is what you’re searching for. OSI model is in charge of guiding vendors and developers so that the program they’ve been using can interoperate (meaning that diverse communication systems can connect and communicate)
                    </p>
                    <h1>What is OSI model:</h1>
                    <p>OSI model, Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework created by the International Organization of Standardization. The main idea of this model is to characterize communication between diverse computing systems. It is divided into 7 abstract layers: physical layer, datalink layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer.</p>

                        <p>OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection model, which is a conceptual
                            framework created by the International Organization of Standardization. It is designed to
                            characterize communication functions of diverse computing systems by dividing network
                            communication into 7 abstract layers: Physical layer, Data Link layer, Network layer,
                            Transport layer, Session layer, Presentation layer, and Application layer.
