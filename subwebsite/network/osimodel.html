                    <h1>Purpose for OSI model:</h1>
                    <p>Think about it. If one day you want to tell someone that there is a problem with your network connection. What are you going to say?
                        “Hey, there is a problem while connecting to the server! ” (what kind of problem? )
                        “Hey, the server is not responding!” (what do you mean “not responding? ” )
                        When network engineers communicate these types of questions, it often leads to misinterpretation. So, what is a reasonable way to identify an error? If you are looking for an answer to this question, OSI model is what you’re searching for. OSI model is in charge of guiding vendors and developers so that the program they’ve been using can interoperate (meaning that diverse communication systems can connect and communicate)
                    </p>
                    <h1>What is OSI model:</h1>
                    <p>OSI model, Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework created by the International Organization of Standardization. The main idea of this model is to characterize communication between diverse computing systems. It is divided into 7 abstract layers: physical layer, datalink layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer.</p>

                                    Physical layer is all about physical medium (physical connection). Think about things you can physically touch that are used to transfer data, such as <strong>cables, pinouts, voltages, NIC</strong> (Network interface card), <strong>hub, and repeater</strong> (I know some of them you might not be familiar with. It’s okay, we will discuss them in the future). Equipment above is considered part of the physical layer. Now, let’s talk about what are some of its major functions.                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Transforming Bits:</b>
                                    <br>So, as you might know, bits are used to transfer data, and Physical layer is the one that encodes bits into signals. You might start wondering, “why is it important to encode them into signals?” Well, if you are transferring data through a physical medium you have to make them into signals. Let’s say one day you have to send your table computer to a different country because you are about to study abroad, there is no way you can just send the whole computer without disassembling it. 
                                </ul>

                                        <b id="signals">Signals:</b>
                                    <br>Let’s talk about signals that I’ve just mentioned. Signals can be divided into two categories: <strong>digital signals</strong> and <strong>analog signals</strong>.
                                    </ul>
                                    <ul>
                                        <ul>
                                            <br>
                                            <b>Digital signals:</b>
                                            <br>As you have seen, digital signals are <strong> square waves.</strong> Besides, it uses binary code to transmit data, meaning that information is represented by <strong>“1”</strong> and <strong>“0”</strong>. Usually, “1” represents a <strong>high</strong> voltage and “0” represents a <strong>low</strong> voltage. Digital signals are generated by <strong>digital modulations</strong> which make them be time separated. It is also more accurate than analog signals. The reason for bringing this up is because it is often used in <strong>computing and digital electronics.</strong> 
                                        </ul>

                                        <ul>
                                            <b>Analog signals:</b>
                                            <br>Different from digital signals, analog signals are sine waves, which are continuous signals. It is often used in audio and video transmission.
                                            Examples of it would be something like signals from temperature sensors and light sensors. However, there is a downside of it, which is that it can be easily deteriorated by noise.

                                    <b>Data Rate:</b>
                                    <br>Physical layer is also in charge of defining how fast the transmission is
                                    <strong>(how many bits per sec).</strong>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Synchronization:</b>
                                    <br>Physical layer manages the synchronization of bits between the sender and receiver by holding a clock. (I know it sounds confusing… Here is a
                                    <a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~comp2322/Bit%20and%20Frame%20Synchronization%20Techiques.pdf" target="_blank">link</a> for you guys if you want  more detailed explanation) In other words, there are differnces between the speed of receivers and that of senders. To solve this problem, synchronization informs the receiver where data entities start and end.
                                </ul>

                                    <br>
                                    This layer can hold two types of configuration:
                                    <strong>point to point configuration </strong>(connection between two devices) and
                                    <strong>multipoint configuration</strong> (connection between more than two devices).
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Topologies:</b>
                                    <br>
                                    According to Cambridge dictionary, topology means "the way in which constituent parts are interrelated or arranged." In this case, it refers to how different devices arranged in network. Some of the most common arrangments are:
                                    <strong>Mesh, Star, Ring, and Bus.</strong>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Transmission Modes:</b> 
                                    <br>
                                    Physical layer also determines the direction of the connection. Some terms you might want to rememeber, such as
                                    <strong>Simplex</strong> (one direction)
                                    <strong>, Half Duplex</strong> (both direction, not the same time)
                                    <strong>, Full Duplex</strong> (both direction, simultaneously)
                                </ul>
