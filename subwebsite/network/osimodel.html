                    <h1>Purpose for OSI model:</h1>
                    <p>Think about it. If one day you want to tell someone that there is a problem with your network connection. What are you going to say?
                        “Hey, there is a problem while connecting to the server! ” (what kind of problem? )
                        “Hey, the server is not responding!” (what do you mean “not responding? ” )
                        When network engineers communicate these types of questions, it often leads to misinterpretation. So, what is a reasonable way to identify an error? If you are looking for an answer to this question, OSI model is what you’re searching for. OSI model is in charge of guiding vendors and developers so that the program they’ve been using can interoperate (meaning that diverse communication systems can connect and communicate)
                    </p>
                    <h1>What is OSI model:</h1>
                    <p>OSI model, Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework created by the International Organization of Standardization. The main idea of this model is to characterize communication between diverse computing systems. It is divided into 7 abstract layers: physical layer, datalink layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer.</p>

                                    Physical layer is all about physical medium (physical connection). Think about things you can physically touch that are used to transfer data, such as <strong>cables, pinouts, voltages, NIC</strong> (Network interface card), <strong>hub, and repeater</strong> (I know some of them you might not be familiar with. It’s okay, we will discuss them in the future). Equipment above is considered part of the physical layer. Now, let’s talk about what are some of its major functions: <strong>transforming bits, data rate, synchronization, line configuration, topologies, transmission modes</strong><a href="http://loophole.studio/subwebsite/network/osimodel.html" onclick="return false" onmousedown="cite_1()">[1]</a></p>

                                    <b id="transform">1. Transforming Bits:</b>
                                    <br><br>So, as you might know, bits are used to transfer data, and Physical layer is the one that encodes bits into signals. You might start wondering, “why is it important to encode them into signals?” Well, if you are transferring data through a physical medium you have to make them into signals. Let’s say one day you have to send your table computer to a different country because you are about to study abroad, there is no way you can just send the whole computer without disassembling it.

                                    <br><br>Let’s talk about signals that I’ve just mentioned. Signals can be divided into two categories: <strong>digital signals</strong> and <strong>analog signals</strong>.<a href="http://loophole.studio/subwebsite/network/osimodel.html" onclick="return false" onmousedown="cite_3()">[3]</a>

                                            <br><br>As you have seen, digital signals are <strong> square waves.</strong> Besides, it uses binary code to transmit data, meaning that information is represented by <strong>“1”</strong> and <strong>“0”</strong>. Usually, “1” represents a <strong>high</strong> voltage and “0” represents a <strong>low</strong> voltage. Digital signals are generated by <strong>digital modulations</strong> which make them be time separated. It is also more accurate than analog signals. The reason for bringing this up is because it is often used in <strong>computing and digital electronics.</strong> 
                                        </ul>

                                            <br><br>Different from digital signals, analog signals are <strong>sine waves</strong>, which are continuous signals. It is often used in <strong>audio and video transmission.</strong>
                                            Examples of it would be something like signals from <strong>temperature sensors and light sensors</strong>. However, there is a downside of it, which is that it can be easily deteriorated by <strong>noise</strong>.

                                    <br><br>Physical layer is also in charge of defining how fast the transmission is <strong>(how many bits per sec)</strong>. It is also known as <strong>data rate</strong> and can be directly related to <strong>bandwidth (physical limitation) and error-rate.</strong>

So, to solve this problem synchronization informs the receiver where data entities start and end.

                                        <br><br>Multiplexing is a way of letting digital signal and analog signal passing through a shared medium simultaneously. Remember all medium all capable of multiplexing, no matter the medium is air (<strong>radio frequency</strong>), physical medium, or light (<strong>optical fiber</strong>). The basic concept of multiplexing is that when multiple computers (senders) send signals to a single medium, there is a device known as the <strong>multiplexer (MUX)</strong> collecting all the signals and distribute them to different parts of the medium. When signals are sent to the other side, another device known as the <strong>De-multiplexer (DEMUX)</strong> will identify all the signals and send them to their destination. Now let’s talk about different types of multiplexing.

                                            <br><br>FDM is used for analog signals. This technology is utilized when the carrier is frequency and signals are sent simultaneously. It might be easier to understand by looking at the following picture.

                                            Frequency spectrum is divided into logical channels, and a frequency known as guard band is used to separate them to avoid overlapping.

                                            <br><br>Different from FDM, TDM can be used to process analog and digital signals. Signals in FDM are sent simultaneously but with different frequency. On the other hand, signals in TDM are sent with the same frequency but at different time. This technology is used when the data rate of the media is greater than that of the source.

So, to solve this problem synchronization informs the receiver where data entities start and end.
