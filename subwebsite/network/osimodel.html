                    <p>Purpose for OSI model:
Think about it. If one day you want to tell someone that there is a problem with your network connection. What are you going to say.

“Hey, there is a problem in connecting the server! ” (what kind of problem? )
“Hey, the server is not responding!” (what do you mean “not responding? ” )

When network engineers communicate these type of questions often lead to misinterpretation.
So, what is a reasonable way to name a specific type of error?

If you are looking for an answer for this question, OSI model is what you’re searching for. OSI model guides the vendors and developers so that the program they’ve been using can interoperate (meaning that diverse communication system are able to connect and communicate; this is just a brief explanation, Strongly suggest you to do some research)

What is OSI model:

OSI model, stands for Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework created by the International Organization of Standardization. It is designed to characterize communication functions of diverse computing systems by dividing network communication into 7 abstract layers: physical layer, datalink layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer.</p>
