                    <p>Think about it. If one day you want to tell someone that there is a problem with your network connection. What are you going to say?<br>
                    “Hey, there is a problem in connecting the server! ” (what kind of problem? )<br>
                    “Hey, the server is not responding!” (what do you mean “not responding?” )<br>
                    When network engineers communicate these types of questions often lead to misinterpretation. So, what is a reasonable way to name a specific type of error? If you are looking for an answer to this question, OSI model is what you’re searching for. OSI model guides the vendors and developers so that the program they’ve been using can interoperate (meaning that diverse communication system can connect and communicate; this is just a brief explanation, Strongly suggest you do some research)</p>
                    <h1>What is OSI model:</h1>

                    <p>OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection model, which is a conceptual framework created by the International Organization of Standardization. It is designed to characterize communication functions of diverse computing systems by dividing network communication into 7 abstract layers: Physical layer, Data Link layer, Network layer, Transport layer, Session layer, Presentation layer, and Application layer.<br><strong>Click again the layer to close it before opening the next one e</strong>

                                <h1>Data Link Layer</h1>
                                <p>When you think of Data Link layer, consider it as the manager who controls data to be transferred from <strong>point to point.</strong> However, it is only in charge of the data that transfer under the <strong>same</strong> network. What is interesting is that Data Link layer takes packages from the <strong>network layer</strong> and breaks them down into <strong>frames</strong>. Let's now talk about the major functions of Data Link layer.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Framing: </b> <br>
                                    As I've mentioned, Data Link Layer will break stream of bits that is received from <strong>Network Layer</strong>, into a manageable unit called <strong>frame.</strong>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Physical Addressing: </b> <br>
                                    Data Link layer will add a <strong>header</strong> in front of the frame, making it recognizable if it is sended to different systems on the network.
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Flow Control: </b> <br>
                                    What if all cars on a highway drive at different speeds? Probably there will be a serious traffic jam. Just like how network will stuck if a <strong>fast transmitter</strong> connects with a <strong>slow receiver</strong>. Data Link layer solves this porblem, making devices connect fluently by controlling the flow.
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Error Control: </b> <br>
                                    To prevent losing frames and unintentional duplications, Data Link layer adds a <strong>trailer</strong> at the end of the frame to detect if anything is missing.
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Multiple Access: </b> <br>To prevent collisions, Data Link layer provides mechanisms such as <strong>CSMA/CD</strong> to make it possible to access shared media from different systems. If you are wondering what CSMA/CD is, here is a <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/csmacd.htm" target="_blank">link</a> for you to learn more.

                                <p>Data Link Layer can be separated into two parts: <strong>Logical Link Control(LLC) and Media Access Control(MAC).</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Logical Link Control(LLC): </b>it deals with <strong>protocols, flow controlling, and error controlling.</strong><br>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Media Access Control(MAC): </b>MAC is a <strong>unique address!</strong> (Different from an IP address which is a type of <strong>logical address</strong> that can be changed) Let's list out some functions MAC perform.
                                    <ul>
                                        It is in charge of encapsulating frames.
