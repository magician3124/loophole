                    <p>Think about it. If one day you want to tell someone that there is a problem with your network connection. What are you going to say?<br>
                    “Hey, there is a problem in connecting the server! ” (what kind of problem? )<br>
                    “Hey, the server is not responding!” (what do you mean “not responding? ” )<br>
                    When network engineers communicate these type of questions often lead to misinterpretation.
                    So, what is a reasonable way to name a specific type of error? If you are looking for an answer for this question, OSI model is what you’re searching for.
                    OSI model guides the vendors and developers so that the program they’ve been using can interoperate (meaning that diverse communication system are able to connect and communicate;
                    this is just a brief explanation, Strongly suggest you to do some research)</p>
                    <h1>What is OSI model:</h1>
                    <p>OSI model, stands for Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework created by the International Organization of Standardization.
                    It is designed to characterize communication functions of diverse computing systems by dividing network communication into 7 abstract layers: physical layer,
                    datalink layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer. <br><strong>Click the layers bellow to look for
                     explanation.</strong>

                                <h1>Data Link Layer</h1>
                                <p>When you think of Data Link layer, consider it as the manager who control data
                                to be transfer from <strong>point to point.</strong> However, it is only in charge of the data that
                                transfer under the <strong>same</strong> network. What is interesting is that Data Link
                                layer takes the packege from the <strong>network layer</strong> and break them down into <strong>frames</strong>. Let's now
                                talk about the major functions of Data Link layer.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Framing: </b> <br>As I've mentioned, Data Link Layer will break the stream of bits,
                                    received from <strong>Network Layer,</strong> into a managable unit called <strong>frame.</strong>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Physical Addressing: </b> <br>Data Link layer will add a <strong>header</strong> in front of the frame, making it
                                    recognizable if it is distributed to different systems on the network.
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Flow Control: </b> <br>What if all the cars on a highway drive with a different speed? Probably there is
                                    going to have a serious traffic jam. Just like how network stuck if a <strong>fast transmitter</strong> connets with a <strong>slow receiver.</strong>
                                    This is also why Data Link layer is important, since it prevents this problem.
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Error Control: </b> <br>To prevent from losing frames and unintentional duplications, Data Link layer add a <strong>trailer</strong>
                                    at the end of the frame to detect if anything is going wrong.
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Multiple Access: </b> <br>In order to prevent collision, Data-link layer provides mechanism such as <strong>CSMA/CD</strong> to make it
                                    possible to access a shared media from different systems. I know you probably never heard of what CSMA/CD is. Don't be too worried
                                    about it, but if you want to know, I would like to explain it in the end of the passage because it involves something you need to know
                                    first, or else more and more wierd terms are going to pop up.
                                </ul>

                                <p>Data Link Layer can be seperated into two parts: <strong>Logical Link Control(LLC) and Media Access Control(MAC).</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Logical Link Control(LLC): </b> it deals with <strong>protocols, flow controlling, and error controlling.</strong> I've done some research before writing
                                    this; however, I didn't understand lots of the information I received... So I decided to just tell you a few general functions it perform. Do some research
                                    if you really want to know more.<br>
                                    <br>By the way, unable to understand the information you are looking for is really common while searching for something that
                                    is so broad. Researching things related to information system will make it even tougher, since there are tons of scientific terms. However, don't give up.
                                    As you know more about this field of knowledge as a whole. Trust me, one day when you looked back on what you didn't understand then, it will be a piece of
                                    cake for you
                                    <br>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Media Access Control(MAC): </b> MAC is a <strong>unique address!</strong> (Not like IP address which is a type of <strong>logical address</strong> that you can change) It deals with the
                                    control of media. I know it sound super vague, but just keep that in mind for now, or else, I'm never going to finish exlpaining OSI model. I might pay more
                                    attention explaining it if I decided to post another post about address in the future.
                                </ul>
                                <p>CSMA/CD, stands for (carrier sense multiple access/collision detection) is
