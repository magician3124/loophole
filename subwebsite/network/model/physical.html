                        Think about it. If one day you want to tell someone that there is a problem with
                        your network connection. What are you going to say?<br>
                        “Hey, there is a problem in connecting the server! ” (what kind of problem? )<br>
                        “Hey, the server is not responding!” (what do you mean “not responding?” )<br>
                        When network engineers communicate these types of questions often lead to misinterpretation.
                        So, what is a reasonable way to name a specific type of error? If you are looking for an
                        answer to this question, OSI model is what you’re searching for. OSI model guides the
                        vendors and developers so that the program they’ve been using can interoperate (meaning
                        that diverse communication system can connect and communicate; this is just a brief
                        explanation, Strongly suggest you do some research)

                        OSI model stands for Open Systems Interconnection model, which is a conceptual
                        framework created by the International Organization of Standardization. It is designed to
                        characterize communication functions of diverse computing systems by dividing network
                        communication into 7 abstract layers: Physical layer, Data Link layer, Network layer,
                        Transport layer, Session layer, Presentation layer, and Application layer.

                                    Physical layer is all about physical mediums (physical connection). Think about things you can physically touch that are used to transfer data, such as <strong>cables, pinouts, voltages, NIC </strong>(Network interface card)<strong>, hub, and repeater </strong>. All of these types of equipment are considered part of the physical layer. Now, let’s talk about what are the major functions of Physical layer.
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Transforming Bits:</b>
                                    <br> So, as you might know, bits are used to transfer data, and Physical layer funtions to encodes bits into signals.
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Data Rate:</b>
                                    <br>Physical layer is also in charge of defining how fast the transmission is
                                    <strong>(how many bits per sec).</strong>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Synchronization:</b>
                                    <br>Physical layer manages the synchronization of bits between the sender and receiver by holding a clock. (I know it sounds confusing… Here is a
                                    <a href="http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~comp2322/Bit%20and%20Frame%20Synchronization%20Techiques.pdf" target="_blank">link</a> for you guys if you want  more detailed explanation) In other words, there are differnces between the speed of receivers and that of senders. To solve this problem, synchronization informs the receiver where data entities start and end.
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Line Configuration:</b>
                                    <br>
                                    This layer can hold two types of configuration:
                                    <strong>point to point configuration </strong>(connection between two devices) and
                                    <strong>multipoint configuration</strong> (connection between more than two devices).
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Topologies:</b>
                                    <br>
                                    According to Cambridge dictionary, topology means "the way in which constituent parts are interrelated or arranged." In this case, it refers to how different devices arranged in network. Some of the most common arrangments are:
                                    <strong>Mesh, Star, Ring, and Bus.</strong>
                                </ul>
                                <ul>
                                    <b>Transmission Modes:</b> 
                                    <br>
                                    Physical layer also determines the direction of the connection. Some terms you might want to rememeber, such as
                                    <strong>Simplex</strong> (one direction)
                                    <strong>, Half Duplex</strong> (both direction, not the same time)
                                    <strong>, Full Duplex</strong> (both direction, simultaneously)
                                </ul>
